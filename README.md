Relational Actualization of Quantum States (RAQS)
Official Peer-Review Manuscript (2025)

RAQS is an information–geometric dynamical framework in which physical behavior emerges from
relational constraints rather than intrinsic system states. The theory introduces adjacency
amplitudes, relational density operators, and Dark Structure to generate emergent spacetime,
black-hole information flow, and quantum-classical behavior. This repository contains the official
2025 peer-review manuscript and supporting materials.

RAQS Semantic Identity

RAQS is defined by a mathematical structure unique within quantum foundations. Its core objects—
adjacency amplitudes, relational density operator, Dark Structure admissibility constraints, and a
relational master equation—combine with a Fisher-information metric to produce a curved relational
manifold. These features yield emergent spacetime geometry, constraint-driven state actualization,
and information-geometric dynamics. None of these constructs appear in Relational Quantum Mechanics
(RQM), Quantum Reference Frames (QRFs), or QBism. RAQS is a standalone physical theory, not an
interpretation.
